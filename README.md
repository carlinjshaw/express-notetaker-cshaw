# SUMMARY
This application uses node.js and express to handle the back-end responsibilities of responsding the fetch requests from the user. 
The router module of express serves several HTML pages and API requests to get and post notes. The get and post routes respond using 
the file system npm package to edit a JSON file asynchronously, which acts as a database.
